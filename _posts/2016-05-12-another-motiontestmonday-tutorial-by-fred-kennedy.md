# CLAYMATION - NOW IN 3D!

Another \#motiontestmonday tutorial by Fred Kennedy

Here's a process for rendering stop-motion style animations out of Cinema 4d. I've used a series of layered model displacements, fingerprint bump-mapping, and after effects post processed displacement to achieve the hand crafted look I was going for. I used the posterize time effect to convert the 24 fps renders into 12 fps final output for the choppy look.
